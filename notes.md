# Feedback

Added this after planning was complete to not impact process.

* Provided short prompt: Simple backend with minimal API, basic config,
console logging, hello world and health endpoints
* No readme or other files, only .claude
* Lacked context of it being a template, README previously provided this and was more accurate
* The validation realized it was over engineering and pulled back: "Inappropriate complexity for current requirements"
* Added DAL and SQL when not needed
* Added app insights in MVP phase
* Added cache, auth, sec in future phases
* Correctly created decision based on MVEA (Minimum Viable Enterprise Architecture)
* Incorrectly added decision to include SQL and full schema design: Database-First Design with Additive Evolution
* Correctly states only to add complexity when needed, but still adds unnecessary bits early on
